# MetaMask-Frontend
ETH Intermediate Module 2 - MetaMask JavaScript FrontEnd

## Description

The project consists of a decentralized application (DApp) that serves as a MetaMask wallet interface allowing users to manage their Ethereum tokens. The frontend is built with React.js and interacts with a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract, named "Assessment," implements basic wallet functionalities such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring tokens. Additionally, the contract enforces certain constraints such as limiting deposit and withdrawal amounts to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10 tokens.

## Executing the program

To begin using the application, make sure to have MetaMask installed on the browser and connected to the Ethereum network. Next is to GitHub and acquire the template repository from template: https://github.com/MetacrafterChris/SCM-Starter by cloning or downloading it. Once the template is downloaded, navigate to the terminal, go to the project directory, and install the necessary dependencies using either npm install. After the dependencies or files have been installed, start the development server by running npm start. This will allow to access the application through your browser at http://localhost:3000. If your MetaMask wallet has not been connected yet, simply click on the "Open My Wallet" button and follow the provided instructions to establish the connection.

## Codes

The JavaScipt Code and Solidity Codes can be found on scm starter codes/contracts/Assessment.sol for the Assessment solidity contract file and scm starter codes/pages/index.js for the JavaScript Frontend codes
